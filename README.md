# MyWebsite

This is my personal project in which I like to experiment with React, CSS and railway. The idea behind this project was to try out new things for me and create something useful at the same time. This project is under constant development whenever I get the itch to try something new. If you found any bugs or have improvement ideas, please let me know!

## Active build

The site is hosted at railway.app using the free description. https://mywebsite-production-fd4a.up.railway.app/

Due to the restrictions on the free version, the website is not active 24/7. If the above link is not working, you can view and interact with the site by running it locally.

## Running locally

1.    Copy the repository to your local machine
2.    Navigate to .../MyWebsite/client
3.    Install the Node modules by running:
```console 
npm install
```
4.    After installing the Node modules, you can start the development build by running:
```console 
npm start
```
5.    After the npm has finished it will open the website. If this fails, you can copy this address and open it in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
